# Greenhouse-Gas
The dataset was downloaded from [stats.govt.nz](https://www.stats.govt.nz/large-datasets/csv-files-for-download/) named "Greenhouse gas emissions by region (industry and household): Year ended 2022 â€“ CSV".
I will use this data to explore the trends over the years of the greenhouse gas emissions in NZ.
